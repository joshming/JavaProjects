# JavaProjects

These Java assignments were for my data structures and algorithm classes. Thus, they focussed on the data structures and applicable algorithms for each.

## [File Compressor](https://github.com/joshming/JavaProjects/tree/main/File_Compressor)
Main data structure: Hash Table \
Collision resolution: Double hashing \

* Program took in a byte type file
* Encoded the bytes and stored them into the hashtable 
* Used bitwise shifts to compress
* Produced a new file of lesser size 

## [PacMan](https://github.com/joshming/JavaProjects/tree/main/PacMan)
Main Data Structure: Binary search tree

In this version of PacMan, the game board consisted of PacMan, barriers, opponents and goals. 

## [Bus Route](https://github.com/joshming/JavaProjects/tree/main/BusRoute)
Main Data Structure: Undirected graph \
Main algorithm used: Depth-First Search
